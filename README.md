Node structures


A lecturer teaches 4 different classes of Data Structures. The number of students in these classes may be different. 
Using the node structures given below, perform the given assignment. Be careful to leave student list as sorted when 
performing the insert operation. Sort will be performed in decreasing order based on the midterm scores. After the 
insert operation is complete, the midterm average of each class will be calculated. The computed midterm average 
will be written to classMidtermAverage in the class list. Then the id of each class and the midterm average will be 
printed on the screen. Write a print method that prints all the structure on the screen to show that the lists are created 
correctly -void printAll(nodeClass *head). Students who begin with StudentID 66 are in class 1, students starting with 
77 in class 2, students starting with 88 are in class 3, and students starting with 99 are in class 4.
